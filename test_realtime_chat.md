## Technical Verification

### Check WebSocket Connection
1. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for: `Echo connected to ws://localhost:8081`
4. Check Network tab → WS (WebSockets) → Should show connected

### Check Events Broadcasting
1. Send a message
2. Console should show:
   - `[Echo] Event received: .message.sent`
   - `[Echo] Event received: .user.typing`

### Check Reverb Server
Terminal should show:
```
Connection from 127.0.0.1:xxxxx
Subscribed to channel: presence-chat.channel.X
Broadcasting message to channel: presence-chat.channel.X
```

## Troubleshooting

### Typing Indicator Not Showing
- ✅ Check Reverb server is running on port 8081
- ✅ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- ✅ Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- ✅ Verify both users are on same channel

### Messages Not Appearing Instantly
- ✅ Check Network tab → WS shows "connected"
- ✅ Verify Echo is initialized (check console)
- ✅ Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
- ✅ Restart Reverb server

### Notifications Not Updating
- ✅ Hard refresh both browser windows
- ✅ Check user permissions (view chat, send messages)

## Fixed Issues
