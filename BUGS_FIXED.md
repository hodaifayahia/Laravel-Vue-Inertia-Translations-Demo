## 🐛 Issue 2: Can't Switch Between Users/Channels
**Problem:** When switching to another user, can't select them or chat freezes

### ✅ Fix Applied:
```typescript
// Clear messages when switching channels
const selectChannel = async (channel: ChatChannel) => {
  messages.value = []  // Clear old messages
  typingUsers.value = []  // Clear typing indicators
  activeChannel.value = channel
  await fetchMessages(channel.id)  // Load new messages
}
```

## 🐛 Issue 3: Messages Appearing in Wrong Conversation
**Problem:** Messages from User A appearing when chatting with User B

### ✅ Fixes Applied:

#### Fix 3A: Channel Validation in WebSocket
```typescript
onMessageSent: (data) => {
  // Only add if message belongs to ACTIVE channel
  if (chat.activeChannel.value?.id === data.message.channel_id) {
    chat.messages.value.push(data.message)
  }
}
```

#### Fix 3B: Polling Channel Validation
```typescript
// Only update if still on same channel after request completes
if (currentChannelId === chat.activeChannel.value?.id) {
  chat.messages.value = newMessages
}
```

- **Status:** ✅ FIXED - Messages only appear in correct conversations

---

## 🐛 Issue 4: Group Chat Creation Not Working
**Problem:** Created groups don't appear or can't be opened

### ✅ Fix Applied:
```typescript
const createChannel = async (type, userIds, name) => {
  const newChannel = await api.post('/chat/channels', {...})
  channels.value.unshift(newChannel)
  await selectChannel(newChannel)  // Auto-select after creation
  return newChannel
}
```
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED - Groups auto-open after creation
