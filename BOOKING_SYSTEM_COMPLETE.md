# Booking System Implementation - Complete

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
Created 4 new tables with migrations:
- **`specializations`** - Medical/service specializations (e.g., Cardiology, Dentistry)
- **`provider_profiles`** - Links users with `book-sys` permission to specializations
- **`provider_schedules`** - Provider weekly availability (days, time slots)
- **`appointments`** - Appointment bookings with status tracking

### 2. Eloquent Models
Created 4 models with relationships:
- **`Specialization`** - With `providerProfiles()`, `activeProviders()` relationships
- **`ProviderProfile`** - With `user()`, `specialization()`, `schedules()`, `appointments()` relationships
- **`ProviderSchedule`** - With `providerProfile()` relationship and helper methods
- **`Appointment`** - With `providerProfile()`, `user()` relationships, status scopes, and reminder tracking
- Updated **`User`** model with `providerProfile()`, `appointments()`, `isProvider()`, `canBook()` methods

### 3. Permissions
Created and assigned permissions via `BookingPermissionSeeder`:
- **`book-sys`** - Provider permission (can provide booking services)
- **`can-book`** - Patient permission (can book appointments)
- **`manage bookings`** - Admin permission
- **`view bookings`** - View permission

Role assignments:
- **Super Admin & Admin**: All permissions
- **Manager**: book-sys, can-book, view bookings
- **User**: can-book (default users can book appointments)

### 4. Controllers
Created 4 controllers with full CRUD operations:

#### **SpecializationController**
- `index()` - List all specializations (admin)
- `store()` - Create specialization
- `update()` - Update specialization
- `destroy()` - Delete specialization
- `active()` - Get active specializations with providers (for booking)

#### **ProviderProfileController**
- `show()` - View/edit provider profile
- `store()` - Create/update provider profile
- `bySpecialization()` - Get providers by specialization
- `index()` - Admin view of all providers

#### **ProviderScheduleController**
- `index()` - View provider schedule
- `bulkUpdate()` - Update weekly schedule
- `availableSlots()` - Get available time slots for a specific date

#### **AppointmentController**
- `index()` - List appointments (provider or patient view)
- `create()` - Show booking form
- `store()` - Book appointment
- `show()` - View appointment details
- `updateStatus()` - Provider updates appointment status
- `cancel()` - Patient cancels appointment

### 5. Routes
Created `routes/bookings.php` with protected routes:
```php
// Specializations (Admin)
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /specializations

// Provider Profile
GET/POST /provider/profile
GET/POST /provider/schedule

// Booking
GET /book (booking form)
GET /appointments (list)
POST /appointments (create)
GET /appointments/{id} (details)

// Provider Actions
POST /appointments/{id}/status (update status)

// Patient Actions
POST /appointments/{id}/cancel (cancel)
```

### 6. Frontend Components
Created 4 Vue/TypeScript pages with modern UI:

#### **Book.vue** - Multi-step booking wizard
- Step 1: Select specialization
- Step 2: Select provider
- Step 3: Select date
- Step 4: Select time slot + notes
- Gradient design, responsive layout

#### **Appointments/Index.vue** - Appointment list
- Different views for providers and patients
- Status badges with color coding
- Quick actions (confirm, cancel, complete)
- Pagination support

#### **Provider/Profile.vue** - Provider configuration
- Specialization selection
- Bio and experience
- Appointment duration (15/30/45/60 min)
- Availability toggle

#### **Provider/Schedule.vue** - Weekly schedule manager
- All 7 days with toggle enable/disable
- Time pickers for each day
- Quick actions (enable all, disable all, apply to all)
- Visual feedback for available days

### 7. Sidebar Navigation
Added to `AppSidebar.vue` with permissions:

**For Patients (can-book permission):**
- 📅 Book Appointment → `/book`
- 📅 My Appointments → `/appointments`

**For Providers (book-sys permission):**
- 🩺 Provider Profile → `/provider/profile`
- 🕐 Provider Schedule → `/provider/schedule`
- 📅 My Appointments → `/appointments`

### 8. Translations
Added to all language files (en, fr, ar, lt):
- `sidebar.bookings` - "Appointments"
- `sidebar.book_appointment` - "Book Appointment"
- `sidebar.my_appointments` - "My Appointments"
- `sidebar.provider_profile` - "Provider Profile"
- `sidebar.provider_schedule` - "Provider Schedule"

## 📋 How It Works

### For Patients (Users with can-book permission):
1. Click "Book Appointment" in sidebar
2. Select a specialization (e.g., Cardiology)
3. Choose a provider from available providers
4. Pick a date
5. Select an available time slot
6. Add optional notes
7. Confirm booking → Appointment created with "pending" status

### For Providers (Users with book-sys permission):
1. Configure provider profile:
   - Select specialization
   - Add bio and years of experience
   - Set appointment duration (15/30/45/60 minutes)
2. Set weekly schedule:
   - Enable/disable days
   - Set start and end times for each day
3. Manage appointments:
   - View all appointments
   - Confirm/decline pending appointments
   - Mark appointments as completed

### Appointment Statuses:
- **pending** - Just booked, awaiting provider confirmation
- **confirmed** - Provider accepted
- **cancelled** - Either party cancelled
- **completed** - Provider marked as done
- **no_show** - Patient didn't show up

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Notification System (Recommended)
Create a job to send reminders:
```bash
php artisan make:job SendAppointmentReminders
```
Schedule to run hourly and check for appointments needing reminders:
- 24 hours before
- 12 hours before
- 5 hours before
- 1 hour before

### 2. Admin Dashboard
Create admin views at `/specializations` for:
- Managing specializations
- Viewing all providers and their stats
- Viewing all appointments system-wide

### 3. Email Notifications
Send emails when:
- Appointment booked (to patient and provider)
- Appointment confirmed (to patient)
- Appointment cancelled (to both parties)
- Appointment completed (to patient)

### 4. Calendar Integration
- Add calendar view for providers
- Export appointments to ICS format
- Sync with Google Calendar

### 5. Ratings & Reviews
- Let patients rate providers after completed appointments
- Display ratings on provider selection
